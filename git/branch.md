* What is git branch ?

An incredibly lightweight yet killer feature of git. Git branch is simply a
lightlightweight movable pointer to a commit.

Git branch creates a branch from a commit. Any changes we make on branch doesn't

on a particular branch. Commits on a branch differs from commit of parent. This
