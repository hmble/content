How we would like to write our blog ?

For now we can have simple notes to use in future.

In order to have detailed blog we need time to do research about everything and
make graphics or videos. We can make simple videos about all this notes. And
explain them in detail in blog posts.

I don't want to rewrite what is already written instead I want to keep different
knowledge in one place for a reference. 

Like for example. During Git branch blog post I couldnt think of a detail blog
post about git branch. As of now I don't know how git branch works under the
hood. So I cannot write detailed blog about git branch. As all those details are
already present in
[git-scm](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) 

See [ Notes ](#NOTE) below **Useful git notes**

#NOTE : 
I want to write all this blog post becuase I want to share knowledge to

community. Remember community is always growing. Each day tons of developers
start their way to software development. So don't worry about publishing this
blog posts. Take your time. 

My inital thought was in order to get a job I need to have a website with tons
of blog posts. _Well you don't._ So I will drop my idea to publish my blog post
until I feel so.

TODO: 
- [ ] I wouldn't post this blogs as to make a useable blog post we need some
  graphics which currently I don't have. Also some videos. For now I will just
  find information and links related to all this questions which are useful to
  me. 

  After I get time to make quality post I will update all this with useful
  graphics and detailed information.

- [ ] Revisit all these blog post to properly write and then publish them. I
  feel that we need quality content for a blog post. And I will do so but right
  now I don't have resources and time to make beautiful graphics.

- [ ] My english is not that good so once I get confidence in my english I will
  rewrite all this blog post.
