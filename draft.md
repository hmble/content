NOTE : I want to write all this blog post becuase I want to share knowledge to
community. Remember community is always growing. Each day tons of developers
start their way to software development. So don't worry about publishing this
blog posts. Take your time. 

My inital thought was in order to get a job I need to have a website with tons
of blog posts. _Well you don't._ So I will drop my idea to publish my blog post
until I feel so.

TODO: 
- [ ] I wouldn't post this blogs as to make a useable blog post we need some
  graphics which currently I don't have. Also some videos. For now I will just
  find information and links related to all this questions which are useful to
  me. 

  After I get time to make quality post I will update all this with useful
  graphics and detailed information.

- [ ] Revisit all these blog post to properly write and then publish them. I
  feel that we need quality content for a blog post. And I will do so but right
  now I don't have resources and time to make beautiful graphics.

- [ ] My english is not that good so once I get confidence in my english I will
  rewrite all this blog post.
