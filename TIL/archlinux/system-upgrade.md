To fully upgrade system packages with AUR packages we have a simple command to
use

For very first time use this command.  

`yay --save --combinedupgrade`

This saves this system upgrade in yay config file. So next time to upgrade
system all we have to do is use `yay` and boom!!!


By default `yay` uses `-Syu`. For more information and different `yay` command
use `yay --help`.
